# My React Native Profile App

## Overview

Welcome to my React Native Profile App! This app allows you to view and edit your profile information. It consists of two main screens: "ProfileScreen" for viewing your profile and "EditProfileScreen" for editing your profile details.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project's file structure:

- `App.js`: The main entry point of the React Native app that handles navigation.
- `ProfileScreen.js`: The screen displaying the user's profile information and a button to edit the profile.
- `EditProfileScreen.js`: The screen where users can edit their profile information.
